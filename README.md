# EcoMeter – Cloud-Based Smart Power Usage Monitoring System ⚡☁️🤖


EcoMeter is a cloud-based IoT solution designed to help MSMEs and users monitor
real-time electricity current usage across multiple locations and devices.
Instead of waiting for monthly electricity bills, EcoMeter provides continuous
visibility into power consumption through a centralized dashboard.

The system uses ESP32 microcontrollers and current sensors to measure electrical
current from appliances such as refrigerators, TVs, music systems, office
equipment, and MSME machinery. Data from different locations is securely sent to
a cloud database, where it is processed, analyzed, and visualized.

EcoMeter also integrates AI-based analytics to calculate daily and monthly usage,
compare consumption with predefined limits, detect abnormal patterns, and help
users make informed energy management decisions.
